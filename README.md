## Playing

In order to play, just visit the gh-pages site for this repository (https://connellhagen.github.io/chess-remake/). This only works locally, so make sure you and your opponent are using the same computer.

All rules that apply in chess are enforced. The game will not allow you to make illegal moves.

To castle, move your king 2 squares to the right or left (the square your king ends up on after castling) and the rook will automatically move.

To perform en passant, just move your pawn to the square it will be on after the capture.

To promote a pawn, move your pawn to the 8th rank (1st rank if you are playing as black) and then a menu will pop up. Simply click on the piece that you wish to promote the pawn to.
